Pre-training involves training a model on large amounts of unlabeled data using self-supervision, enabling the model to learn general linguistic structures.\n* **Types of Pre-training Tasks**:\n\t+ **Masked Language Modeling**: A popular self-supervised task where a model predicts masked tokens in a sequence, using both left and right context. BERT is an example of this approach.\n\t+ **Decoder-only and Encoder-only Pre-training**: These tasks involve training a model to predict tokens based on preceding context (decoder-only) or encoding the entire sequence (encoder-only).\n\t+ **Encoder-Decoder Pre-training**: This approach is used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where an encoder processes a prefix and a decoder generates the suffix.\n* **Comparison of Pre-training Tasks**: While masked language modeling is simple and widely applied, it has drawbacks like the use of a special token ([MASK]) and the lack of dependency between masked tokens.

        "summary": "Deep learning models are often pre-trained using three main approaches: unsupervised, supervised, and self-supervised. Unsupervised pre-training optimizes neural network parameters without task-specific labels, often using reconstruction cross-entropy. This step aids in discovering better local minima and adds regularization, making subsequent supervised learning more efficient. Supervised pre-training involves training a model on one task and adapting it to another with minimal labeled data. Self-supervised pre-training uses unlabeled data with self-supervision, enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks through fine-tuning or prompting. These methods are crucial for scaling up deep learning models and improving their performance on various tasks."
