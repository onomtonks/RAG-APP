There are two way to chunk the data Firstly.take each page summarise it using gpt model and then embed the summary,It might work for a single book of multiple books .but I am planing to add research papers in the knowledge base.

I am planing to combine bert an PCA to clusterise paragraphs and make each cluster a single chunk.
